  "summary": "Core single-page Valentine prompt and the dodging \"No\" interaction are implemented, with warm-theme styling and heart animations. However, several text-exactness requirements are not met (button labels and reveal message), and the required generated image assets (and explicit collage background usage) are not evidenced in the diff. The diff also introduces unrelated Internet Identity/react-query/back-end scaffolding not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Show two clearly labeled buttons exactly: \"Yes\" and \"No\".",
      "reason": "The \"Yes\" button label is not exactly \"Yes\"; it includes extra punctuation/emoji (\"Yes! 💕\"). The \"No\" label cannot be confirmed due to truncation.",

Thank you for everything. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for all the moments we have spent together. Be happy, stay healthy. Happy Birthday Pondati, my sweet potato!\"",
      "reason": "The displayed message text differs from the required exact text: it uses straight apostrophes (\"you're\", \"didn't\") instead of the curly apostrophes shown in the spec (you’re, didn’t), and adds extra emojis to the final line (\"🥔💕\"). Also the message is split with a separate title plus paragraphs rather than the exact full message string.",
